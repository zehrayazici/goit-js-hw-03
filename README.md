# goit-js-hw-03

This project was developed to further strengthen practical JavaScript skills by implementing DOM manipulation, event handling, and interactive functionality within a static HTML context as part of the GoIT curriculum.

Aligned with essential JavaScript development principles:

- JavaScript is used to control interactive behavior and manipulate DOM elements based on user actions.
- Script files are organized within a dedicated `js/` directory to reinforce modular code organization and separation of concerns.
- Standard coding conventions are applied, including clear naming of functions and variables, and consistent formatting to improve readability and maintainability.
- The project focuses on vanilla JavaScript techniques without reliance on external libraries.
- The HTML structure is designed to support dynamic behaviors implemented via JavaScript while maintaining semantic correctness.

This repository represents the third assignment in the GoIT JavaScript module and demonstrates practical application of scripting, DOM interaction, and event‑driven patterns in a client‑side environment.
